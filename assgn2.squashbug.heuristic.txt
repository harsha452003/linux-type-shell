First we find PID's of parent, parent(parent), parent(parent(parent)) ...so on and store it in process vector.

Then to find the malware we traverse through all processes in process vector and find
parameter = (Sum of cpu times of all children of a process)/(cpu time of the process)

The process with highest parameter value is considered as the root of malware 
    *(If we get root as malware then we print no malware is present)
    *(if cpu time of a process is 0 then the process is the root of all trouble)
